                I am a problem solver and team-player by heart,
                always looking for the next challenge.
                I love trying out new things and am constantly giving 100% on every project Iâ€™m contributing to.<br>

                So the obligatory how I got started with programming story:
                I taught myself BASIC in school using my textbook.
                My first nontrivial program was a text adventure game.<br><br>
                I studied Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Artsakh State University(bachelorâ€™s degree).
                At the same time I started working as a graphic designer.<br>
                In 2016 I moved to Yerevan and started working in an Animation Studio.
                As a personal project I wanted to build some kind of digital asset management system at my work.
                So I started diving deeper in programming.<br>
                As of 2020 Iâ€™m working as a freelance developer for 2 years. Building web and desktop apps and automating workflows.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="text_sans">Tools</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                Sublime and Visual Studio Code are my editors of choice.
                Iâ€™ve used various flavors of Linux on the desktop:
                Linux Mint, CentOS, Ubuntuâ€¦<br><br>
                As far as programming languages, my weapon of choice is Python, but I believe in using the best tool for the job.<br>
                If you are someone who enjoys long lists of keywords, here are a few that Iâ€™ve worked with most recently:
                Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, PyQt5, Pytest, Numpy, Pandas, ES6, TypeScript, React, P5, Underscore, Java, Git, Linux, Docker, MongoDB, Postgres, Lua, Osl.<br><br>
                I have a good working knowledge of:
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>Object-oriented Programming</li>
                <li>Design Patterns</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
                I am a fast learner, constantly studying and improving my skills.<br>
                There is a long list of languages and tech that I want to explore further.
                At the top is GO, Pythonâ€™s data science and computer vision tools,
                and machine learning.<br>
                I love problem solving and competitive programming. I always participate in challenges at websites like
                <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Codewars</a>
