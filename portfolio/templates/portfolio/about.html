                Hi, my name is Harutyun Harutyunyan. I work as a <a href="#developer">developer</a>
                and <a href="#cgi">computer graphics</a> artist.<br><br>
                I am a problem solver and team-player by heart,
                always looking for the next challenge.
                I love trying out new things and am constantly giving 100% on every project Iâ€™m contributing to.<br>

                So the obligatory how I got started programming story:
                I taught myself BASIC in school using my textbook.
                My first nontrivial program was a text adventure game.<br><br>
                I studied Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Artsakh State University.
                In the same time I started working as a graphic designer.<br>
                After university I abandoned programming for quite a while and was working as system administrator,
                was doing more design work and learning computer graphics.<br>
                In 2016 I moved to Yerevan and started working in an Animation Studio.
                As a personal project I wanted to buid some kind of digital asset management system at my work.
                So I started studying programming again.<br><br>
                As of 2020 Iâ€™m working as a freelance developer for 2 years. Building web and desktop apps and automating workflows.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="text_sans">Tools</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                Sublime and Visual Studio Code is my editors of choice.
                Iâ€™ve used various flavors of Linux on the desktop:
                Linux Mint, CentOS, Ubuntuâ€¦<br>
                In the end I realized that once the OS is set up and configured, they are all pretty much the same.<br>
                Currently my development machin runs on Ubuntu. But Iâ€™m occasionally switching to Windows 10 so i'm utilizing the best of both.<br><br>
                As far as programming languages, my weapon of choice is Python. Also I have some experience with Java,
                JavaScript(React, P5) and Lua.<br>
                I have a good working knowledge of:
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>Object-oriented Programming</li>
                <li>Design Patterns</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
                I am a fast learner, constantly studying and improving my skills.<br>
                There is a long list of languages and tech that I want to explore further.
                At the top is GO, Pythonâ€™s data science and computer vision tools,
                and some of the JavaScript frameworks like Angular.<br><br>
                I love problem solving and competitive programming.I always participating in challenges on websites like
                <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.codewars.com" target="_blank">Codewars</a>
